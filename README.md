This package implements handlers for various US Government APIs provided that the user has a registered API key for the API if required. 

So far, only the Federal Reserve's FRED API has been implemented. 

Future versions will implement handlers for the following APIs:

    * US Census
    * Bureau of Labor Statistics
    * Bureau of Economic Analysis
    * Congress
    * National Weather Service
