# GovData

This package implements handlers for various US Government APIs provided that the user has a registered API key for the API if required. 

So far, only the Federal Reserve's FRED API has been implemented. 

Future versions will implement handlers for the following APIs:

* US Census
* Bureau of Labor Statistics
* Bureau of Economic Analysis
* Congress
* National Weather Service
